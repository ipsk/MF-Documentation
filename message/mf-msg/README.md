### What is MF-MSG?

This is a library that allows you to parse simple Markdown messages \(based on Discord's\) into a JSON message or string.

The lib works from 1.8 till 1.16. Gradients and rainbows won't work on versions prior to 1.16, however hex colors will be converted to the closes legacy version.
{% endhint %}
